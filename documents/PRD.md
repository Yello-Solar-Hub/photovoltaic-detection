# Product Requirements Document

This project aims to build an accelerator platform for the global energy transition. It combines computer vision models for rooftop analysis with a modern web interface and payment integrations. Key capabilities include:

- Detection of available rooftop area using the provided PyTorch models
- Next.js front-end served from `apps/web`
- Payment modules (HyperSwitch, Lago Billing) for SaaS subscriptions
- Tokenization workflows and carbon credit NFTs
- Integrations with mapping libraries (MapLibre, Mapillary, OSM BR)
- Support for OpenAI Codex based agents and assistants to help automate sizing recommendations

Future iterations will expand the datasets and add real-time edge search capabilities.
