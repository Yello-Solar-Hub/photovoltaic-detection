# Energy Generation Tiers

This reference summarizes photovoltaic system categories and suggested site requirements. Use these guidelines when evaluating a client's available roof area and energy needs.

| Category | Approx. Capacity (kWp) | Typical Use Case | Min. Roof Area (mÂ²)* |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| XPP | 2 | Small households | 15-20 |
| PP  | 3 | Medium households | 25-30 |
| P   | 5 | High usage homes or small shops | 40-50 |
| M   | 8 | Medium commercial | 60-80 |
| G   | 12| Large commercial or small rural | 100-120 |
| GG  | 20| Medium enterprises | 160-200 |
| XG  | 30| Industrial/large commercial | 240-300 |
| XGG | 50| Near microgeneration limit | 400-500 |

\*Actual required area depends on panel efficiency and local regulations.
