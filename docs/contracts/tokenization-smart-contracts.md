# Tokenization and Smart Contracts Guide

This document summarizes regulatory considerations and a high-level architecture for tokenizing solar projects, issuing NFTs, and generating carbon credits through smart contracts.

## Regulatory Coverage
- Review national energy regulations and securities laws before issuing tokens.
- Confirm eligibility for carbon credit generation according to environmental agencies.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and consumer protection rules when recording project metadata on-chain.

## Tokenization Workflow
1. Register photovoltaic project details (capacity, location, owner) in an off-chain database.
2. Deploy a smart contract representing ownership shares or production credits.
3. Mint NFTs corresponding to verified project milestones or certificates.
4. Distribute carbon credit tokens based on measured energy production.

## Recommended Smart Contract Features
- Role-based access control for project creators, auditors, and investors.
- Functions to issue, transfer, and retire tokens.
- Integration hooks for IoT or monitoring systems to validate production data.

## Carbon Credits
- Each credit represents 1 ton of CO2 avoided or other recognized unit.
- Credits can be traded on compatible marketplaces or retired to offset emissions.
